Djity documentation is based on Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/index.html)
which uses the reStructuredText format (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html)

To be a powerful contributor you should probably check some documentations
from the links above. But you can also juste see for yourself by browsing the
files in the source directory.

Djity uses a script 'generate_modules.py' to generate recursively
its API documentation files. It comes from here:

https://bitbucket.org/etienned/sphinx-autopackage-script/src

We use it like that in the Makefile:

python generate_modules.py -n Djity -s rst -d ./source/api ../djity
